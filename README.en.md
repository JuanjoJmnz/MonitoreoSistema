## üßæ About the Project

This project contains two scripts written in **Bash** that allow for a **complete system diagnosis** and also **real-time monitoring** of CPU and memory usage. It is designed for support technicians or system administrators who want simple and effective tools without graphical interfaces.

- `detalles.sh`: Generates a full system report.
- `monitoreo.sh`: Monitors system performance in real time.
